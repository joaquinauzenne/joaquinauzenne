Hello and Welcome! 👋
I am Joaquin and I am a recent graduate ('25) from the University of Texas at Austin in BS Mathematics and BS Computational Biology.

🔭 I'm currently interested in metabarcoding for conservation efforts and species identification, understanding the evolution of language in primates and neurolinguistics, and (generally) tackling hard interdisciplinary problems through applications of mathematics (i.e. statistics, modeling, analysis, etc). 

In my "free-time"...

🌱 I’m currently learning continuum mechanics, functional analysis for applied mathematicians, and working on biological sequence analysis pipelines to improve my capabilities in bioinformatics.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting research projects in any field where I may apply my curiosity!

💬 Ask me about Bioinformatics, Applied Mathematics, Philosophy, or anything else!

💬 I support open science, education, and scholarship. All scientific data should be [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Resusable for all digital assets!]([url](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/))

📫 How to reach me: Email at joaquinauzenne@utexas.edu (for academic stuff) and auzenne.work@gmail.com (for other work stuff)

😄 Pronouns: He / him

⚡ Fun fact: I love learning languages through new music, film, conversation, and reading! My spotify is a happy mess as a result!
