Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
I am Joaquin and I am a recent graduate ('25) from the University of Texas at Austin in BS Mathematics and BS Computational Biology. My academic webpage is {WIP}.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently interested in metabarcoding, neurolinguistics, and tackling biological problems through statistical and mathematical modeling. Currently, I am interested in the following problems:

- How can we conserve species diversity and biological information by gathering and analyzing environmental DNA?
- How does language arise from homind neurocognitive evolution? What analogs exist to human language in other species?
- How can predictive mathematical modeling inform our understanding of biological structures like DNA and proteins?

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning continuum mechanics, functional analysis for applied mathematicians, and biological sequence analysis.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting research projects!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Bioinformatics, Applied Mathematics, and Philosophy!

ðŸ’¬ I support open science, education, and scholarship. Scientific data should be [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Resusable for all digital assets!]([url](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/))
